 - reading file $HOME/.sharrc

'uuencode' is used to create an ASCII representation of a file that can be
sent over channels that may otherwise corrupt the data.  Specifically,
email cannot handle binary data and will often even insert a character when
the six character sequence "\nFrom " is seen.

'uuencode' will read 'in-file' if provided and otherwise read data from
standard in and write the encoded form to standard out.  The output will
begin with a header line for use by 'uudecode' giving it the resulting
suggested file 'output-name' and access mode.  If the 'output-name' is
specifically '/dev/stdout', then 'uudecode' will emit the decoded file to
standard out.

'Note': 'uuencode' uses buffered input and assumes that it is not hand
typed from a tty.  The consequence is that at a tty, you may need to hit
Ctl-D several times to terminate input.
